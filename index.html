	<h1>1803 BrainTiedt_Prework Day 7 UX</h1>

	<dl>
		<dt>1.Psychology: How much work does the user have to do to get what they want? </dt>
			<dd>GOOD Example:<a href="https://www.apartments.com/">Apartments.com</a>. Home page is direct to the options important to the user. Most information is directed to the users "home" location with out of state options listed near the bottom. BAD Example: <a href="https://www.apartmentlist.com/">ApartmentList.com</a>. Home page comes up with Denver as location but then shows information about apartments all across the country. User needs to scroll mostly to the bottom to reach information that is important to them.</dd>
		<dt>2.Usability: Are you working with the userâ€™s assumptions, or against them? </dt>
			<dd>GOOD Example: <a href="https://www.apartments.com/">Apartments.com</a>. Pulling my information form my location, the home page populates with Denver, then shows me information related to Denver. BAD Example: <a href="https://www.apartmentlist.com/">ApartmentList.com</a>. This seems to try and offer anything except what the user is trying to locate.</dd>
		<dt>3.Design: Does it communicate the purpose and function without words? </dt>
			<dd>GOOD Example: <a href="https://www.apartments.com/">Apartments.com</a> Site has a Header clearly separate with information for menu, site name, and account information. The Body Menu is accented with a underline that moves to the item that is moused over. BAD Example: <a href="https://www.apartmentlist.com/">ApartmentList.com</a>. Main view on Home page load has very little user interface and blends in mostly to the background.</dd>
		<dt>4.Copywriting: Is it clear, direct, simple, and functional?</dt>
			<dd>GOOD Example: <a href="https://www.apartments.com/">Apartments.com</a>. From Home page user can alter search parameters moving to direct results with one click. BAD Example: <a href="https://www.apartmentlist.com/">ApartmentList.com</a>. User needs to move to next page from Home in order to stipulate search parameters </dd>
		<dt>5.Analysis: How can you use this analysis to make improvements?</dt>
			<dd>GOOD Example: <a href="https://www.apartments.com/">Apartments.com</a>. Bad Example: BAD Example: <a href="https://www.apartmentlist.com/">ApartmentList.com</a>. I would use information to tell me how long people are on the site and if they located their information or gave up.</dd>
